# Matrix Algorithms: Inversion and Multiplication

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of algorithms for matrix inversion and multiplication, developed as part of a half-semester project at **Sorbonne University**, supervised by **Jérémy Berthomieu**.

## Overview

The project focuses on implementing and optimizing key matrix algorithms, including:
- PLUQ decomposition
- **Strassen's algorithm** for matrix multiplication and inversion.
- Benchmarks to analyze execution time and memory usage.

## Features
- Implementation of classical and optimized matrix algorithms.
- Performance analysis with detailed benchmarks.
- Insights into algorithmic trade-offs in terms of speed and memory.
